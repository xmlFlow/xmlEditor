This OJS plugin opens an xml file  and opens it for an editor.
i want another button of the pugin to convert a word xml file using this project.https://github.com/withanage/docxToJats ( readme has instructions )
After converting, button (Open Editor) should redirect to the xml editor like the edit xml button
add the project as a gitsubmodule depdendancy.
First show me the plan.
